# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System

A simple **content-based movie recommender** built with Python and Streamlit. Enter a movie you like, and the app recommends similar movies along with their posters fetched from **TMDB**.

## Features

- **MovieLens Small Dataset** integration (movies + ratings)  
- **Content-based recommendations** using genre similarity  
- **Top-rated movies table** and **data exploration metrics**  
- **Poster display** for top recommendations using TMDB API  
- **Minimum rating filter** directly in the main UI  
- **Full top 10 recommendation table**  
- Clean and polished **Streamlit UI** with grid layout

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- TMDB API Key ([Get one here](https://www.themoviedb.org/))  

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender.git
cd movie-recommender
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add your TMDB API key in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
[tmdb]
api_key = "YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY"
```

5. Ensure the `assets/no_poster.png` file exists (used as a placeholder).

### Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- Enter a movie title (partial or full) in the input box.
- Adjust the minimum rating filter if desired.
- View top 5 recommendations with posters and full top 10 table.

### Dataset

**MovieLens Small Dataset** (download link included in repo)

Includes:

- `movies.csv` â€” movie titles & genres
- `ratings.csv` â€” user ratings

The app automatically downloads the dataset if not present.

### How It Works

1. Loads MovieLens dataset and extracts genres & year.
2. Builds a genre matrix and computes cosine similarity for content-based recommendations.
3. Filters recommendations by minimum average rating (if selected).
4. Fetches movie posters from TMDB using cleaned titles and year.
5. Displays results in a poster grid and a full table.
